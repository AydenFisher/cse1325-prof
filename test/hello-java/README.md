Java Build
==========

OpenJava is included in the virtual machine. If missing in your own environment, install either Java or Open Java version 11 or later.

Compile and run the command line program using

``javac Hello.java ; java Hello``

Compile and run the Swing program (with native graphical user interface) using

``javac GUI.java ; java GUI``

Compile and run the Java-Gnome program (with a graphical user interface based on Gtk+, as C++ gtkmm is, which requires adding a library to the javac and java commands) using

``./GtkHello``


(Hint: You can select the above command in the editor with your mouse, then point to the terminal window and click the MIDDLE mouse button to paste it!)

Java *may* be offered as an option for advanced students this semester, if time permits.
